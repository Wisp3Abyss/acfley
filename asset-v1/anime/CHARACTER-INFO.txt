BEAT1 - Dream

This is the conceptualization of [REDACTED]'s fear after experiencing trauma when encountering a rotting corpse in the ventilation of his best friend's home. He thought it was alive and froze in the same place for 26 hours, waiting for it to snap to life and kill him. His friend was convicted of murder and he was given therapy which then resulted in this document being recorded. A crude drawing by the person undergoing therapy was given.
----------------------------------
BEAT2 - Hart

Hart was a victim in the apartment fire caused by Kurt. Hart ran out of the building without her arms, bleeding and her torso was on fire. She passed out on the street and almost died but a by-stander had called 111 before many people died. Hart suffered severe vocal damage and trying to speak caused her to spew blood on the floor. After being put back into an "optimal" state she was taken to recovery where she currently is right now.
----------------------------------
BEAT3 - Baylee

This was a "sculpture" donated to a museum, many people reported hearing muffled screaming coming from the statue. After 6 days of being up in the museum an investigation was made and it was found out that it was the top half of a person with a hole drilled in their head, covered in clay. They were somehow alive but had died minutes before the investigation. It appeared as if he died after the clay around the neck broke and the weight of the other clay put on the head snapped his head off.
----------------------------------
BEAT4 - Hue

A great friend of [REDACTED]. However, they were known to be alcoholic and was once found being mauled by a tiger at a zoo after it had closed. Thankfully, someone who was on the night shift had seen this and shot the tiger. [REDACTED] tried to re-assemble their corpse to bring him back to life.

BEAT5 - Classified/Prototype 3

Our third prototype. It was a success but failed in form. We could only simulate her pain and not actually revive her.
----------------------------------
EFFECT1 - Ethan Taddpoll

Ethan Tadd Poll was a musician with great talent. Unfortunately he was murdered at the age of 19 via being shot in the eyes with a pistol and then having a tuba dropped onto his face. It appeared that he was murdered by another musician called Lilac but she was proven innocent a few weeks ago.
----------------------------------
EFFECT2 - Hety

One of the few cultists we were able to find, strangely they had advanced body augmentations curing the AIDS she had.
----------------------------------
EFFECT3 - Dougg

He deserved it...
----------------------------------
EFFECT4 - AZ-TF

Our 4th prototype, it had failed as the 2 subjects we were testing had fused and became two consciousnesses. We only wished to use Zeta's skin and not fuse Alpha and Zeta, but the wounds were more severe than we thought.
----------------------------------
EFFECT5 - Lilac

Lilac was a famous musician. Then one day at a concert they were murdered on stage by what the audience described as 'a mass of wires covered in oil tangled around a shadowy figure'. This did not seem like a person but rather a machine however it was apparently 'too natural to be artificial'.
----------------------------------
MELODY1 - Stanlee

A man who is currently relatively unknown was found running around a homeless shelter naked and they were extremely high on psilocybe cubensis. After running outside many people recall him cackling hysterically as he ran. He was then chased by police then beat to death outside of an elderly woman's home.
----------------------------------
MELODY2 - Archeture Blunt

This was an old TV that was tampered with using ferrofluid and rotting flesh.
----------------------------------
MELODY3 - Kurt

Kurt was a 12 year old child who suffered from schizophrenia, he was very introverted and did not speak often so his hallucinations were never brought up before with his parents. At 5:25 AM on the 24th of May, he set a building on fire due to his undiscovered schizophrenia. Most people in the building evacuated but Kurt had trapped himself in the building after many vivid hallucinations. When the building collapsed he was stuck in the rubble for 2 days before being excavated and sent to the hospital where he was heavily wrapped in bandages. He died later that day.
----------------------------------
MELODY4 - Cratz Pur

Cratz Pur was our first attempt at attempting at mimicking the technology used by the cult to restore people to optimal states. He had an extreme injury causing near death experience. Many of his senses were damaged but the Mimic was very effective.
----------------------------------
MELODY5 - Dave/Tab

Not much known about Tab, all we know is that he works in an office building and has a strange body pigment disorder. why was i told to write this document?
----------------------------------
VOICE1 - James

James had no care for his own life and was extremely aggressive towards all people he had known in his life. This resulted in what he called his "final act". He had put his neck in a vice and killed himself simply to spite his loving father. Later he had awoke in the ceiling of an apartment building where he was tortured by many people via acts such as killing his dog and stealing his belongings. Afterwards they had led a child into the building and forced the child to set the building on fire. The child is crying.
----------------------------------
VOICE2 - Derick

Derick's body was found dead in a newly resurrected apartment with 2 nails in his eyes and a car jack beside him covered in blood. He was still alive but by the time he was found he had starved before any medical attention could be brought to him. Dave's uniform was beside him and this uniform led him to an office building, however the owner of the building said that Dave died years ago, even thought forensics showed that the corpse was only present in that location for 3 days.
----------------------------------
VOICE3 - Duck

Our final experiment. It was 100% success as the duck became immortal after using ferrofluid and could be easily be tortured.
----------------------------------
VOICE4 - Kaski

Kaski was a youtuber who explored the genre of 3:AM horror with a twist. Obviously there wasnt such a thing as an UwU cult so she hired actors. Her depiction of a cult was very offensive and we had killed her to repay the mockery. She was revived however and sent back into society where she later deleted her channel and went to therapy for 17 years.
----------------------------------
VOICE5 - Andrew

Andrew was reported missing for 26 days until he was found at the bottom of a lake, dead and high on drugs. Not much else is known about him.
